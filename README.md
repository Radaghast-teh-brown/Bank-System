# Bank-System
Bank System using Java.

## Step 1 - Creating a basic bank system to implement the fundamental function of a ATM. 
I am using OOP to generate this system so I can practice for my future lectures in the college.

## Step 2 - Using chat GPT 
As almost all the junior software engeneer I am worried about the chat GPT. Lots of peaople are saying that we will be replaced by this powerful tool.
From my point of view we need to learn how to use this tool and not try to avoid it. In some level, we all will be affected by this thecnology. 

I ask chat GPT some help in my banking system. So te answer was some prerequesites that can me used in my program. The image bellow shows the answer.
